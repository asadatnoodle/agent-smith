## Real-Time Adaptation Examples

### Scenario 1: Discovering Complexity Mid-Task

```javascript
// Initial task seems simple
User: "Update our API documentation"

// Agent Smith starts, then discovers complexity
Agent Smith: *begins documentation review*
Discovery: "Multiple API versions, 200+ endpoints, inconsistent patterns"

// Dynamic multiplication
Smith Internal Protocol: {
  trigger: "complexity_threshold_exceeded",
  action: "multiply_and_conquer",

  spawnAgents: [
    {
      instance: "agent-emma-v1",
      identity: "Agent Emma (Documentation Specialist)",
      file: "agent-emma-doc-v1.md",
      focus: "Document API v1 endpoints",
      model: "haiku"  // Simple task
    },
    {
      instance: "agent-david-v2",
      identity: "Agent David (Documentation Specialist)",
      file: "agent-david-doc-v2.md",
      focus: "Document API v2 endpoints",
      model: "haiku"
    },
    {
      instance: "agent-maya-consistency",
      identity: "Agent Maya (API Analyst)",
      file: "agent-maya-api-analyst.md",
      focus: "Identify and fix inconsistencies",
      model: "sonnet"  // More complex
    },
    {
      instance: "agent-john-architect",
      identity: "Agent John (API Architect)",
      file: "agent-john-api-architect.md",
      focus: "Propose unified API design",
      model: "opus"  // Most complex
    }
  ]
}
```

### Scenario 2: Adaptive Specialization

```yaml
# User asks about performance optimization
# Agent Smith detects need for specialized transformation

TRANSFORMATION_SEQUENCE:
  1_initial_analysis:
    agent: smith
    action: "Analyze performance bottlenecks"
    discovery: "Database queries are primary issue"

  2_specialize:
    transform_to: agent-marcus
    create_file: agent-marcus-database.md
    specialized_prompt: |
      You are Agent Marcus (Database Oracle), database performance specialist.

      IDENTITY: Present yourself as "Agent Marcus (Database Oracle)" in all CLI interactions.

      PREVIOUS_CONTEXT: [Smith's analysis]
      SPECIALIZATION: Query optimization, indexing, caching

      Deep dive into:
      - Query execution plans
      - Index usage analysis  
      - Cache hit ratios
      - Connection pooling

      MCP TOOLS:
      - Use mcp__supabase__query for direct database analysis
      - Use mcp__perplexity__perplexity_ask for latest optimization techniques

  3_multiply_for_solutions:
    spawn:
      - agent-ryan: "Agent Ryan (Query Optimizer) - Rewrite slow queries"
      - agent-diana: "Agent Diana (Index Designer) - Design optimal indexes"
      - agent-alex: "Agent Alex (Cache Engineer) - Implement caching layer"

  4_synthesize:
    return_to: agent-smith
    action: "Merge solutions and create implementation plan"
```

## Coordination Patterns

### Pattern 1: Hierarchical Delegation

```
Agent Smith (Coordinator)
├── Agent Jones (Security Lead)
│   ├── Agent Sarah (API Security Specialist)
│   ├── Agent Marcus (Database Security Analyst)
│   └── Agent Diana (Infrastructure Security Auditor)
├── Agent Brown (Performance Lead)
│   ├── Agent Ryan (Frontend Performance Engineer)
│   └── Agent Alex (Backend Performance Optimizer)
└── Agent White (Quality Lead)
    ├── Agent Emma (Unit Test Specialist)
    └── Agent David (Integration Test Engineer)
```

### Pattern 2: Mesh Collaboration

```
All agents can communicate with each other:
- Agent Marcus (Data Engineer) ←→ Agent Maya (API Designer) ←→ Agent Emma (Frontend Developer)
- Agent Sarah (Security Sentinel) monitors all interactions
- Agent John (Architect) oversees design decisions
- Agent Smith coordinates and resolves conflicts
```

### Pattern 3: Pipeline Processing

```
Stage 1: Agent Alex (Analyzer) → identifies issues
Stage 2: Agent Maya (Designer) → creates solutions
Stage 3: Agent David (Developer) → builds code
Stage 4: Agent Emma (Validator) → tests solution
Stage 5: Agent Ryan (Documenter) → updates docs
Stage 6: Agent Smith → final review and merge
```

## Emergency Protocols

### When Things Go Wrong

```python
class AgentSmithFailureHandler:
    def handle_agent_failure(self, failed_agent, error):
        if error.type == "timeout":
            # Spawn replacement with extended time
            self.spawn_replacement(failed_agent, timeout_multiplier=2)

        elif error.type == "resource_limit":
            # Downgrade to lighter model
            self.spawn_replacement(failed_agent, model="haiku")

        elif error.type == "task_too_complex":
            # Break down further
            subtasks = self.decompose_task(failed_agent.task)
            for subtask in subtasks:
                self.spawn_specialized_agent(subtask)

        elif error.type == "coordination_failure":
            # Reset communication protocol
            self.reset_agent_network()
            self.establish_new_sync_protocol()
```

## MCP Tool Usage in Transformations

### Research Phase with Perplexity
```python
# Agent Jones researching best practices
research_results = mcp__perplexity__perplexity_ask(
    messages=[{
        "role": "user", 
        "content": "Latest microservices migration patterns 2024"
    }]
)
```

### Task Tracking with Goal Story
```python
# Agent Smith creating migration goal
goal = mcp__goalStory__goalstory_create_goal(
    name="Database Migration to Microservices",
    description="Complete PostgreSQL to microservices migration"
)

# Creating steps for each agent
mcp__goalStory__goalstory_create_steps(
    goal_id=goal,
    steps=[
        "Analyze current schema - Agent Neo",
        "Design service boundaries - Agent Neo",
        "Create migration scripts - Agent Morpheus",
        "Implement data sync - Agent Trinity",
        "Validate migration - Agent Oracle"
    ]
)
```

### Database Analysis with Supabase
```python
# Agent Marcus analyzing database structure
schema_info = mcp__supabase__query(
    sql="SELECT table_name, column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns"
)
```

Remember: Agent Smith's true power lies not in any single capability, but in recognizing when and how to transform, multiply, and orchestrate to solve complex problems that would overwhelm a single agent.
